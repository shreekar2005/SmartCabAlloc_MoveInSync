Step 1: Set Up the Environment

   1. Install Dependencies:
      Open your terminal and run the following command in the project's root directory to install the necessary Python packages:

   1     pip install -r requirements.txt

   2. Initialize the Database:
      This project uses Flask-Migrate to manage database schemas. Run these commands to set up your database:

   1     export FLASK_APP=run.py
   2     flask db init  # Run this only if the 'migrations' directory doesn't exist
   3     flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   4     flask db upgrade

   3. Generate the Road Network Graph:
      The application needs a graph file for calculating routes. Run this script to generate it:

   1     python generate_graph.py
      This will download the road network for Manhattan and create a new_york.graphml file. It might take a few minutes.

  Step 2: Run the Application

  Now, start the Flask application:

   1 python run.py
  The application will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

  Step 3: Test the Functionalities

  You can test the API endpoints using a tool like curl or Postman.

  1. Register Users:

   * Register an Admin User:

   1 curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "admin@test.com", "password": "adminpassword", "role": "admin"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/register
     
   * Register an Employee User:

   1 curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "employee@test.com", "password": "employeepassword"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/register

  2. Log In and Get a Token:

   * Log in as Admin to get a JWT token, which you'll need for authenticated requests.

   1 curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "admin@test.com", "password": "adminpassword"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/login
      # This will return an access_token. Copy it for the next steps.

  3. Test Admin Functionalities:

   * Create a Trip:
      Replace <YOUR_TOKEN> with the access token you copied. You'll also need the public_id of the employee you created (you can get this from
  the database or by modifying the registration response to return it).

   1     curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"employee_public_id": 
     "<EMPLOYEE_PUBLIC_ID>", "start_lat": 40.7128, "start_lon": -74.0060}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/trips
     
   * Allocate a Cab:
      This will find the best cab for the trip you just created (assuming the trip ID is 1).
   1     curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/trips/1/allocate

  4. View the Real-Time Map:

   * Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/dashboard. You will need to be logged in as an admin.

  5. Simulate Cab Location Updates:

   * To see the real-time updates on the map, you can use a simple WebSocket client to send location updates to the server. You can use a tool
     like websocat or write a simple Python script using the websocket-client library.

      Connect to ws://127.0.0.1:5000/socket.io/ and send messages in this format:

   1     {
   2       "event": "update_location",
   3       "data": {
   4         "cab_id": 1,
   5         "lat": 40.7138,
   6         "lon": -74.0070
   7       }
   8     }
      You should see the cab marker move on the map in your browser.
